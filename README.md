 Please use XAMPP apache in order to run the local server and add this folder to ../xampp/htdocs
 Please connect to the login.php file on your localhost as this is where the application begins.
 Just connecting to local host will bring up crud functionality but is not technically the beginning of the application.

 Also when uploading file to github I changed name for each branch incase of it not working
 make sure to rename folder to "crud_sqlite3" as this is what I had the folder named for both application on my local machine and worked perfectly
